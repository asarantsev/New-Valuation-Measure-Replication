# New-Valuation-Measure-Replication-With-Annual-Volatility
This replication of my work arXiv:1905.04603 A New Stock Market Valuation Measure with Applications to Retirement Planning with Annual Volatility done by Angel Piotrowski. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04603 for the original work. 

I explained in brief this previous work in the blog post https://my-finance.org/2025/02/20/replicated-arxiv1905-04603-with-annual-volatility/

Current work is explained in another post https://my-finance.org/2025/02/20/new-bubble-measure-replicated-with-stochastic-volatility/

TR.py is the replication of my results without dividing total returns by annual volatility, computed by Angel Piotrowski in another repository. Noormalized TR.py is the replication after such dividing. 

The six plots are ACF for original (ACF in title) and absolute values (ACFA in title) of innovations and the QQ plots of innovations versus the normal distribution. The letter R shows non-normalized and NR shows normalized versions.
