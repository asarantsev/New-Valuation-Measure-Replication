# New-Valuation-Measure-Replication-With-Annual-Volatility
This replication of my work arXiv:1905.04603 A New Stock Market Valuation Measure with Applications to Retirement Planning with Annual Volatility done by Angel Piotrowski. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04603 for the original work. 

I explained in brief this previous work in the blog post https://my-finance.org/2025/02/20/replicated-arxiv1905-04603-with-annual-volatility/

Current work is explained in another post https://my-finance.org/2025/02/20/new-bubble-measure-replicated-with-stochastic-volatility/

TR.py is the replication of my results with CPI data for December of each year rather than the January of the following year, and for S&P 500 data from the last trading day of the year, rather than January daily average of the following year.

The three plots are ACF for original (ACF in title) and absolute values (ACFA in title) of innovations and the QQ plots of innovations versus the normal distribution.
